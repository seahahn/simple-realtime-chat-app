Remember, the key to these challenge is not just to complete them but to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
It should be kept simple and therefore been delivered fast (5 days). Semantic HTML is really important to us.

## How to deliver

The project should be visible to us via Github or another Version Management system. It should contain a readme telling our dev team how to start it.
